# Welcome to SEACrowd!

Southeast Asia is home to more than 1,000 native languages. Nevertheless, Southeast Asian NLP, vision-language, and speech processing is underrepresented in the research community, and one of the reasons is the lack of access to public datasets ([Aji et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.500/)). To address this issue, we initiate **SEACrowd**, a joint collaboration to collect NLP datasets for Southeast Asian languages. Help us collect and centralize Southeast Asian datasets, and be a co-author of our upcoming paper.

## How to Use

### Library Installation

Find seacrowd library (v0.1.3) at https://pypi.org/project/seacrowd/. (See our release notes [here](https://github.com/SEACrowd/seacrowd-datahub/releases/tag/0.1.3).)

To install SEACrowd, install the `seacrowd` package in your python environment via `pip`.

```
pip install seacrowd
```

### Using `seacrowd` library

To use the `seacrowd` package, simply import it in your code:
```
import seacrowd as sc
````

### List & Load Dataset
SEACrowd provides functions for listing and loading all datasets that are implemented in NusaCrowd
```
# List all datasets
dset_names = sc.list_datasets()

# List all datasets with their config names
dset_configs_dict = sc.list_datasets(with_config=True)

# Load a single dataset based on the dataset name
khpos_dset = sc.load_dataset("khpos", schema="seacrowd")

# Load multiple datasets based on the dataset names
dsets = sc.load_datasets(["thai_sum", "vsolscsum"], schema="seacrowd_t2t")
```

### List & Load Benchmark
In addition to dataset-related functions, SEACrowd provides additional functions for listing and loading some SEA benchmarks.
```
# List all benchmarks
benchmark_names = sc.list_benchmarks()

# Load all datasets in a benchmark
seacrowd_vl_dsets = sc.load_benchmark("SEACrowd-VL")
```

### Load Metadata
Aside from loading datasets and benchmarks, `seacrowd` also supports loading the metadata (e.g., license, description, citation,  etc.) of the dataloaders.
```
# Load metadata of a dataloader
khpos_meta = sc.for_dataset("khpos")

# Load metadata of multiple dataloaders
meta_dsets = sc.for_datasets(["thai_sum", "vsolscsum"])

# Load metadata of a config name
nusaparagraph_meta = sc.for_config_name("nusaparagraph_emot_jav_seacrowd_text")

# Load metadata of multiple config names
meta_dsets = sc.for_config_names(["sentiment_nathasa_review_seacrowd_text", "indonli_seacrowd_pairs"])
```

We can also load the dataloader from the metadata if we want.

```
# Load dataset from metadata
khpos_dset = khpos_meta.load_dataset()
```
